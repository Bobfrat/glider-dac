A new Glider Deployment ({{ deployment.username }} / {{ deployment.name }}) has been created. 

DeploymentInfo:
    URL: {{ url_for('show_deployment', username=username, deployment_id=deployment._id, _external=True) }}
    DAP: {{ deployment.dap }}
    ISO: {{ deployment.iso }}
    SOS: {{ deployment.sos }}
{% if deployment.wmo_id %}
    WMO_ID: {{ deployment.wmo_id }}
{% else %}
    THIS DEPLOYMENT NEEDS A WMO_ID



Once a WMO_ID is received, place it in the directory inside of a file named "wmoid.txt".

{% endif %}

Thank you for your cooperation
